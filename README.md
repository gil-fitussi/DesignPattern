<h1>Design Pattern</h1>

<h2>Creational<h2> 
<h3>Singleton</h3> 
The singleton pattern restricts the initialization of a class to ensure that only one instance of the class can be created. 

<h3>Method Factory</h3> 
Python Design Patterns: -03- The Factory | by morf | MediumThe factory pattern takes out the responsibility of instantiating an object from the class to a Factory class. (Without knowing the logic inside of the factory) 

<h3>Builder</h3> 
Creating an object step by step and a method to finally get the object instance. 

<h3>Prototype</h3> 
Creating a new object instance from another similar instance and then modify according to our requirements.  

<h2>Structural</h2>

<h3>Adapter</h3> 
Provides an interface between two unrelated entities so that they can work together. 

<h3>Decorator</h3> 
The decorator design pattern is used to modify the functionality of an object at runtime.  

<h3>Composite</h3> 
Used when we have to implement a part-whole hierarchy. For example, a diagram made of other pieces such as circle, square, triangle, etc. 

<h3>Proxy</h3>
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
 

<h2>Behavioral</h2> 

<h3>Observer</h3> 
Useful when you are interested in the state of an object and want to get notified whenever there is any change. 

<h3>Memento</h3> 
The memento design pattern is used when we want to save the state of an object so that we can restore later on. 

<h3>Template Method</h3> 
used to create a template method stub and defer some of the steps of implementation to the subclasses.
